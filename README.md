# ballwork-web
---
Ballwork is a web application built with FastAPI that allows people to search for football players and teams around the world and check their stats in real time. It also allows users to get notified of their favorite teams and players whenever they like, getting an email or notification whenever they so desire.
Ballwork is part of a final year project comparing the constraints between monolith and microservice based systems, where the objective is to compare:
- The tooling used
- How scalable each they are
- How robust each architecture is to failures
- How "observable" each architecture is.
The application is a simplified version of a real-world application, which should allow to build a fairly comprehensive application and allows for very good separation of concerns for the microservice implementation.
